You design a system to track information about animals in a zoo.

Animals:
- Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
- Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
- It is characterized by species in groups such as rodents (rats, beavers, etc.).
- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
- species name, weight, age, etc.
- The system should also be able to get the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage()
- System should be able to calculate Feed times => getFeedSchedule()
- The logic for the system to perform these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses and different for tigers.
