You design a system to track information about animals in a zoo.

Animals:
- Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
- Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
- It is characterized by species in groups such as rodents (rats, beavers, etc.).
- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
- species name, weight, age, etc.
- The system should also be able to get the dosage of specific drugs for each animal -> getDosage()
- System should be able to calculate Feed times -> getFeedSchedule()
- The logic for the system to perform these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses and different for tigers.

Design a system for the management of flights and pilots.

Airlines operate the flights. Every airline has an identity.
The airline has different types of aircraft.
Aircraft may be operational or in a state of repair.
Each flight has a unique identity, airport to take off and land at, and departure and landing times.
Every flight has a pilot and co-pilot, and they operate the plane.
Airports have unique IDs and names.
Airlines have pilots, and each pilot has a level of experience.
An aircraft type may need a certain number of pilots.
