- Create an ArrayList of numbers from 1 to 100.
- Next, divide the 100 elements in this ArrayList into 4 equal parts to be 25 elements.
- Design 4 separate Threads that find odd and even numbers in these ArrayLists.
- 4 Thread will add the even numbers it finds to a common ArrayList.
- 4 Thread will add the odd numbers it finds to a common ArrayList.
- ArrayLists holding odd and even numbers will be empty when first created.
